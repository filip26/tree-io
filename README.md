# oxygen-tree-io

**Uniform API to read/write tree data models — cross-format, cross-library.**

**oxygen-tree-io** provides a consistent abstraction for working with **tree-like data structures**.  It is **format-agnostic** (JSON, YAML, CBOR, …) and **library-agnostic** (Jackson, Gson, Jakarta, …),  allowing you to **read, manipulate, and write trees uniformly** without depending on a specific parser or serializer.

## Features

- Uniform, library-agnostic API for tree data processing
- Supports multiple formats: JSON, YAML, CBOR
- Works with Jackson, Gson, Jakarta, and other libraries
- Extensible adapter model for adding new formats or libraries

## Use Cases

- Uniform processing of tree-structured data
- Building library-agnostic processors and pipelines

## Example

```javascript

```
